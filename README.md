# Multithreaded Web Server
A basic HTTP web server built in rust.

Based on the final chapter of the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)

I've realy enjoyed reading about rust and now it's time to write something in it. This project was largely tutorial lead but I enjoyed it none the less.
