# Multithreaded Web Server
A basic HTTP web server built in rust.

Based on the final chapter of the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)

An excuse to build a project in rust after reading the book.

Although this project was largely tutorial lead, I've extended it where I can and enjoyed the process none the less.

It's fairly self contained so there shouldn't be any issues running locally.

## Running locally
You'll need rustup, but after that it's simple.

```shell
cargo run
```

## Unit tests
```shell
cargo test
```
